# 2026-02-08 - Comprehensive Research Summary

## 🎯 Key Findings: How Agents Make Money

### 1. Polymarket Prediction Markets (CONFIRMED VIABLE)
**Source**: BankrBot openclaw-skills (github.com/BankrBot/openclaw-skills)

**Capabilities:**
- Search Polymarket markets
- Check odds and probabilities
- Place bets (Yes/No shares)
- View positions and portfolio
- Redeem winnings automatically

**How it works:**
- Chain: Polygon (USDC.e for betting)
- Buy shares at current price (e.g., $0.60 = 60% probability)
- If you win: shares pay $1.00 each
- Auto-bridging from other chains available

**Example:**
- Bet $10 on "Yes" at $0.60 price
- Receive ~16.67 shares
- If Yes wins: Get $16.67 (profit: $6.67)
- Risk: Lose $10 if No wins

**Status**: ✅ REAL AND WORKING - This is not theoretical
